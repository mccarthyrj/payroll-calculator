# Payroll Calculator
Calculate driver payroll.

## Description
The payroll calculator can assist with the complex way in which most truck drivers are paid. Instead of an hourly wage, over-the-road drivers are generally given a per-mile rate based on the number of miles driven in a given pay period. Additionally, pay may also consist of a guaranteed minimum, detention (pay for delays at delivery or load sites), line haul revenue bonus (percentage of total revenue of goods delivered in a given pay period), and other factors based on company standards.

The goal of the calculator is to alleviate the manual calculations needed to determine pay and allow back office personnel to enter the criteria, click a few buttons, and submit a final dollar amount to the payroll company.

### Instructions
1. Enter the number of miles driven over desired period.
2. Enter the rate of mileage for the driver.
3. Click 'Calculate Base Pay'.
4. Add any optional bonus amounts and click 'Caclulate Bonus'.
5. Click 'Calculate Total Pay'.
